Q1. The notation was changed for Sigma

Q3. The equations was changed to remove the integral using the corollary2. s = [s1, s2] was used to eliminate the confusion in representation.

For conditional distribution we changed the equation to represent in a mathematical form like f(x) = {0 otherwise;1 for a < x < b}

Q4. The variable "t" was marked as the observed variable in the graphical model figure using a different shade for it.

Q5. Gibbs sampler: Histograms plots for different values of K were given so as to infer how k=800 was chosen. As suggested in the comment we rectified the mistake where we had used standard deviation and mean for different plots. We also wrote on the initialization of the parameters we had used.

Q6. ADF section was simplified and made concise.

Q7. Model for prediction ---------to write

Q8. Factor graphs: The figure was changed to make the notations clear to understand by using bigger & bolder fonts. 

Q9. Message passing algorithm---------to write

Q10. Your own data: the preprocessing steps and initialization values were included as per the comments in the review.

Q11. Open ended project extension ----------to write

The reference section-----remove redundant trueskill link

Format: the report was contained in 8 pages. so according the format now.
